# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props short for properties, are things that can be applied to components when using React. So when you are coding in JSX (through React), you use the props commands to iterate over your main file App.js to your files located within the components folder so that they can basically take effect. 

  Researched answer: With JavaScript, React props are function arguments that are attributes in HTML. Due to JSX's being similiar to native HTML, when you want to send props to a component you use the same syntax as HTML attributes. This ensure the given component gets that argument as a props object. In other words, props help you pass whatever data parameters wished to be used from one component to the next and that all are point back to the original App.js file. 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event occurs when the user(s) getting involed somehow, meaning if the user clicked on a coded element of your webpage some sort of action will be occurring. This event happens becuase it was something that was previously coded into the HTML page; like if a user clicks on this button then something pops up on the screen or with an interactive app...maybe a game is started. 

  Researched answer: A DOM event gives access to JavaScript to acknowledge certain event handlers on HTML elemnts in a document, webpage, or application are occuring. These type of events are primarily used with functions so in order for the event to actually happen some kind of function needs to be executed. For example, a common event would be `onClick` which activates an event to occur when the user clicks on an element written into a site. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is focused around using objects as a baseline of coding your data. A good example of this is when using the the programming language Ruby. So what makes functional programming different than OOP is its centered around applying coded methodology to the data itself instead of by using object creation to do so. 

  Researched answer: The primary point around object-oriented programming is it focused on the creation of objects that contain both data and methods to get desired outputs. By doing things this way, it makes code run more smoothly and easier to execute because this style of programming provides a clearer structure for the programs used thus making it more probable to develop reusable applications that also contains less lines of code, which would in turn lead to less time writing such code. 
  
  Functional programming differs in that its style of writing is seemingly more complex or can be long-winded in appearence due to its focus on treating code as evaluated mathematical functions and thus is extra particular with the syntax. A good a example of this would be if you needed to write a function that gave a group of words displayed as strings, but for some reason needed the function to remove all the vowels of within the string of words and then output the result as an array; by doing this in JavaScript (functional programming) it would take several lines of code and some time to get to the desired output, where as using a programming language like Ruby (object-oriented programming) it would be more simple, use less code and therefore not take as long to get the expected result. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: In Ruby, a float is seen essentially seen as a type of integer/number that is not a whole number, but a decimal number or fractionalized integer. On the other hand, an Integer is basically the opposite so instead of a fractionalized number it is a whole number. For reason, Ruby like programmers to differentiate the two when a float or integer is needed as input values. 

  Researched answer: Ruby uses object-oriented programming, so it creates objects that contain data and methods. This is important to note because objects are often associated with various classes and thus in Ruby there is a Numeric class. Floats and Integers make up only two of the total amount of subclasses within the Numeric class. In Ruby, the Float class is seen as "imprecise" because number values that are consider floats are decimal numbers or fractionalized whole numbers; while number values from the Integer class only contain whole numbers. You can transfer number values between the two classes using some of Ruby's available built-in methods like `to_i`, which converts an input number value from its current value into an Integer or one may use `to_f`, which similarly will change the current number value of an input to output that value as a Float. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return when it comes to Ruby means you don't have to explicitly say "return" when you are writing your code. It means it already implied throughout by how your function is setup.

  Researched answer: Within Ruby there is an option to use implicit return, meaning it will return the last evaluated line or code statment (expression) that was provided. This is used to keep the code simple and concise. In other words, with implicit return, the return is implied. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: a dynamic variable used only when an object is created and define in a class on the outer layer of method, block or constructor.

2. PostgreSQL: a type of SQL that is open-source relational, highly stable database system that is mainly used for various web, mobile, analytics applications 

3. Ruby on Rails: is an open-source web applicaiton development framework from the Ruby language that simplies the creation of web applications

4. ORM: stands for object-relational mapping, often used in PostgreSQL is a way of converting data between systems through OOP thus creating virtual object databases to do so. 

5. Active Record: help prevent one from having use SQL directly because it will perform queries on the databases for you  while also being compatible with most database systems like SQL.
